## Api Used

```
    random-words - to generate random words
```


  ## Requirements

  - [] When the game is started, the player is represented with an empty field for each letter in the word.
  - [] When the player guesses a letter correctly, each field that represents that letter is filled with the letter
  - [] When the player guesses a letter incorrectly, a piece of a gallows with a hanging man is drawn
  - [] After 10 incorrect guesses, the game is over and the player lost.
  - [] Thus, there should be 10 different states of the gallows to be drawn.
  - [] If all fields are filled with their letter before 10 incorrect guesses, the player has won the game.
